Tax classes (Steuerklassen) determine how much income tax is deducted from your salary in Germany. Understanding which class applies to you can help you optimize your take-home pay and avoid overpaying taxes.

## The Six Tax Classes

**Class I (Klasse I): Single or Divorced**

- Most common for single workers
- Standard tax allowances applied
- Largest tax deductions

**Class II (Klasse II): Single Parents**

- Higher allowances than Class I
- Requires proof of single parenthood
- Best rates for single parents

**Class III (Klasse III): Married, Higher-Earning Spouse**

- Lower tax deduction (more take-home pay)
- Paired with Class V for spouse
- Benefits the higher earner

**Class IV (Klasse IV): Married, Both Earn Similarly**

- Both spouses get standard deductions
- Most common for married couples
- Fair when incomes are equal

**Class V (Klasse V): Married, Lower-Earning Spouse**

- Higher tax deduction
- Paired with Class III
- Benefits the lower earner (tax on spouse)

**Class VI (Klasse VI): Second Job**

- No tax allowances
- Automatic for additional jobs
- Highest tax rate

## How to Choose or Change

**Automatic classification:**

- Based on marital status and employment
- Changed automatically at employer

**Manual change:**

- Request at local tax office (Finanzamt)
- Required for: marriage, divorce, birth of child
- Can also request change anytime

## Impact on Net Salary

**Example (annual income €50,000):**

- Class I: ~€3,000 tax/year
- Class III: ~€2,200 tax/year (higher earner)
- Class V: ~€3,800 tax/year (lower earner)

_Actual amounts depend on other factors_

## When to Request a Change

- After marriage or divorce
- Birth or adoption of children
- One spouse significantly earns more
- Spouse becomes unemployed

## Year-End Tax Return

- Tax class doesn't determine final tax
- Employer withholds based on class
- File tax return (Steuererklärung) to settle differences
- Many people receive refunds after filing
