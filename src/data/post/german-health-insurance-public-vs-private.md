Germany has a dual health insurance system: public (gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) and private (private Krankenversicherung). Understanding the differences is crucial for making the right choice for your situation.

## Public Health Insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung)

### Pros

- Mandatory for most residents
- Premiums based on income (around 8% of gross salary)
- Family members can be insured for free
- Wide network of doctors and hospitals
- Affordable and comprehensive

### Cons

- Limited choice of providers
- Longer waiting times for specialists
- Standard coverage only

## Private Health Insurance (Private Krankenversicherung)

### Pros

- More services and amenities
- Faster appointments with specialists
- Freedom to choose doctors and hospitals
- Better coverage in some areas

### Cons

- Premiums increase with age
- Health screening required
- Difficult to switch back to public
- Not suitable for families (covers only insured individuals)
- More expensive for older individuals

## How to Choose

**You MUST join public insurance if:**

- Your income is below €69,300/year (2025)
- You're an employee in most sectors
- You're not self-employed or civil servant

**You CAN choose private insurance if:**

- Your income is above €69,300/year
- You're self-employed or freelancer
- You're a civil servant

## Key Providers

**Public Insurance:**

- TK (Techniker Krankenkasse)
- AOK
- DAK-Gesundheit
- Barmer

**Private Insurance:**

- Allianz
- AXA
- DKV
- Ottonova

## Switching Between Systems

- **Public to Private:** Possible after 5 years, rarely reversible
- **Private to Public:** Very difficult once you switch out

## Important: Switching Before Moving

Make your choice early. It's hard to change once you're enrolled, so take time to evaluate both options.
