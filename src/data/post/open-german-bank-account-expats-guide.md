Opening a bank account is one of the first steps for expats moving to Germany. This guide covers the documents you need, how to choose the right bank, and tips for a smooth process.

## Why You Need a German Bank Account

Most employers, landlords, and service providers require a German bank account for payments and direct debits. International accounts are rarely accepted for everyday transactions.

## Required Documents

- Passport or national ID
- Proof of address (Anmeldung)
- Visa or residence permit (if applicable)
- Employment contract (sometimes)

- **Deutsche Bank** - Large traditional bank with many branches
- **Commerzbank** - Good customer service for international clients
- **Sparkasse** - Local savings banks with helpful staff

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Choose your bank and book an appointment** (if needed)
2. **Gather your documents** (listed above)
3. **Visit the branch or apply online**
4. **Complete the application and verify your identity**
5. **Receive your IBAN and debit card** (usually within 1-2 weeks)

## Tips for Success

- Online banks are faster but may require video identification
- Some banks offer accounts for non-residents
- Always check for fees and language support
- Keep your IBAN safe - you'll need it for employment and payments

## Common Questions

**How long does it take?**
Online banks: 2-3 days. Branch banks: 1-2 weeks.

**Do I need an Anmeldung?**
Officially yes, but some online banks accept applications before registration.

**Are there monthly fees?**
Most banks for expats offer free accounts for under €3,000 income.
