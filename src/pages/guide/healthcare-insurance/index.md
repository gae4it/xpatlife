| **Switching** | Can switch providers annually | Difficult to switch back |
| **Age** | Same rate regardless of age | Increases with age |

## Who Should Choose What?

### Choose Public Insurance If:
- You're employed with salary under €69,300
- You have a family (spouse/children get free coverage)
- You want simplicity and stability
- You're older (costs don't increase with age)

### Consider Private Insurance If:
- You earn over €69,300 or are self-employed
- You're young and healthy (lower initial costs)
- You want premium services (shorter wait times, private rooms)
- You have no dependents

## Cost Examples

### Public Insurance
- **Single person earning €40,000**: ~€300-350/month
- **Single person earning €60,000**: ~€450-500/month
- **Family (2 adults, 2 kids) earning €50,000**: ~€375-425/month (family covered)

### Private Insurance
- **25-year-old single person**: ~€200-300/month
- **35-year-old single person**: ~€350-450/month
- **50-year-old single person**: ~€600-800/month
- **Family of 4**: Each person pays separately (can be €1,500+ total)

## Important Notes

### Mandatory Coverage
- You **must** have health insurance from day one
- No coverage = no residence permit
- Gaps in coverage can cause visa problems

### Pre-existing Conditions
- Public insurance must accept everyone
- Private insurance can reject or charge more
- Declare all conditions honestly

### Pregnancy and Children
- Public: Maternity fully covered, children free
- Private: Extra costs, children need separate insurance

## Registration Process

1. Choose a provider (TK, AOK, Barmer, etc.)
2. Register online or in person
3. Provide employment contract and Anmeldung

## Tips for Expats

1. **Get insured before arrival** if possible
2. **Public is usually better** for most expats
3. **Think long-term** - hard to switch from private to public
4. **Family matters** - public covers family free
