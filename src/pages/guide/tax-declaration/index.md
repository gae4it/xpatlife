## Understanding the German Tax System

### Tax Classes (Steuerklassen)

Your tax class determines how much tax is withheld from your salary:

| Class   | Who                           | Monthly Tax Withholding     |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **I**   | Single, divorced              | Standard                    |
| **II**  | Single parent with child      | Lower (child allowance)     |
| **III** | Married, higher earner        | Lowest (combined with V)    |
| **IV**  | Married, both working equally | Standard                    |
| **V**   | Married, lower earner         | Highest (combined with III) |
| **VI**  | Second job                    | Very high                   |

**You can change tax class** - Important for married couples to optimize
