## Understanding the German Tax System

### Tax Classes (Steuerklassen)

Your tax class determines how much tax is withheld from your salary:

| Class | Who | Monthly Tax Withholding |
|-------|-----|------------------------|
| **I** | Single, divorced | Standard |
| **II** | Single parent with child | Lower (child allowance) |
| **III** | Married, higher earner | Lowest (combined with V) |
| **IV** | Married, both working equally | Standard |
| **V** | Married, lower earner | Highest (combined with III) |
| **VI** | Second job | Very high |

**You can change tax class** - Important for married couples to optimize

### What Gets Taxed?

**Income Subject to Tax:**

- Self-employment income

- Pensions
- Foreign income (in most cases)

**Tax-Free:**
