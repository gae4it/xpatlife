      <h2>Understanding German Salary Calculations</h2>
      
      <h3>What is Brutto (Gross Salary)?</h3>
      <p>
        Your Brutto salary is the total amount your employer pays you before any deductions. 
        This is the figure typically mentioned in job offers and employment contracts.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Netto (Net Salary)?</h3>
      <p>
        Your Netto salary is what you actually receive in your bank account after all taxes and 
        social insurance contributions have been deducted. This is your "take-home pay."
      </p>

      <h3>Deductions Explained</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Income Tax (Einkommensteuer):</strong> Progressive tax based on your income level</li>
        <li><strong>Solidarity Surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag):</strong> Additional tax (currently being phased out for most earners)</li>
        <li><strong>Health Insurance (Krankenversicherung):</strong> Approximately 7.3% of gross salary</li>
        <li><strong>Nursing Care Insurance (Pflegeversicherung):</strong> Approximately 1.525% of gross salary</li>
        <li><strong>Pension Insurance (Rentenversicherung):</strong> Approximately 9.3% of gross salary</li>
        <li><strong>Unemployment Insurance (Arbeitslosenversicherung):</strong> Approximately 1.3% of gross salary</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tax Classes (Steuerklasse)</h3>
      <p>
        Your tax class affects how much income tax is deducted. The calculator allows you to select 
        from different tax classes based on your personal situation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Class I:</strong> Single or divorced</li>
        <li><strong>Class II:</strong> Single parent</li>
        <li><strong>Class III:</strong> Married, higher-earning spouse</li>
        <li><strong>Class IV:</strong> Married, both spouses earn similarly</li>
        <li><strong>Class V:</strong> Married, lower-earning spouse (paired with Class III)</li>
        <li><strong>Class VI:</strong> Second job</li>
      </ul>
