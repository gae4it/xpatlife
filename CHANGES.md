Change log and decision history for building the xPatLife website (Astro).

---

## 2025-09-09

- **Project initialization**: Created a new Astro project for the xPatLife website.
- **Content structure definition**: Analyzed the table of contents of the book “xPatLife: Living and Working in Germany” (170 pages) to organize the content for the site.
- **Structure discussion**: Evaluated the best solution between a blog with tags and pages/subpages. Decided to combine pages/subpages for the main guide and a blog with tags for dynamic content.
- **Proposed file system structure**: Suggested a folder and file structure for Astro, with main pages, subpages for chapters, a blog for extra articles, and a resources directory.
- **Navigation decision**: Planned to implement a hierarchical menu, search bar, and sidebar navigation to facilitate content access.
