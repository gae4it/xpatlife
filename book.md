# SECTION I: PLANNING YOUR MOVE

## Chapter 1: Can I Move to Germany?

### Immigration Requirements for Non-EU Citizens

Moving to Germany requires proper planning and understanding of visa requirements. Your citizenship determines which rules apply to you.

Non-EU citizens must obtain a visa or residence permit before working or living in Germany long-term. Short visits under 90 days may not require a visa depending on your country of origin.

#### Types of Visas and Permits

The German immigration system offers several visa categories:

- Employment Visa: For those with a job offer from a German employer
- Blue Card: For highly-qualified professionals with university degrees and job offers with minimum salary requirements
- Job Seeker Visa: Allows you six months to find employment in Germany
- Student Visa: For enrollment at German educational institutions
- Family Reunion Visa: For joining family members already living in Germany
- Self-Employment Visa: For entrepreneurs and freelancers
- Working Holiday Visa: Available to young people from select countries

#### Application Process and Documentation

To apply for a German visa:

- Complete the application form for your specific visa type
- Gather required documents:
  - Valid passport
  - Passport photos meeting biometric requirements
  - Proof of financial means
  - Health insurance certificate
  - Proof of accommodation
  - Specific documents for your visa type (job contract, university admission, etc.)
- Book an appointment at the German embassy or consulate in your home country
- Pay the application fee
- Attend the interview

Processing times vary from 2 weeks to 3 months depending on visa type and your country.

#### Timeline and Planning Considerations

Plan your move at least 4-6 months before your intended arrival date:

- Research and decide on visa type: 1-2 weeks
- Collect required documents: 2-4 weeks
- Embassy appointment waiting time: 2-8 weeks
- Visa processing: 2-12 weeks
- Finding accommodation: 1-3 months
- Notifying current employer/landlord: varies by country

Start your visa application process early to avoid delays in your relocation timeline.

### EU Citizens: Freedom of Movement Rights and Limitations

EU citizens enjoy significant advantages when moving to Germany:

- No visa required to enter, live, or work in Germany
- Right to seek employment on equal terms with German nationals
- Can start working immediately upon arrival
- No formal work permit needed

Requirements for EU citizens:

- Register your address within 14 days of finding permanent accommodation
- Show proof of employment or financial self-sufficiency
- Obtain health insurance coverage

For stays longer than three months, you must meet one of these conditions:

- Be employed or self-employed
- Study at a recognized institution
- Have sufficient financial resources and health insurance
- Be a family member of someone meeting these criteria

### Brexit Implications for UK Citizens

Since Brexit, UK citizens are now subject to different rules:

- UK citizens no longer have automatic freedom of movement rights
- For stays beyond 90 days, a visa or residence permit is required
- Those living in Germany before December 31, 2020 have protected rights under the Withdrawal Agreement
- New UK arrivals must apply through standard non-EU channels

If you're a UK citizen who was resident in Germany before the Brexit transition ended, you must have applied for a residence document by June 30, 2021.

### Pre-Arrival Checklist: Essential Tasks Before Moving

#### Coverage Under German Insurance

Mental health treatment is covered by German health insurance, but with specific conditions:

Public Insurance Coverage

- Therapy sessions - Typically covers up to 25 sessions initially, with possible extensions
- Psychiatric care - Covered when referred by your primary doctor

Accessing Covered Care

- Get a referral from your primary doctor for a psychiatrist
- For psychotherapy, you can contact therapists directly without a referral
- The therapist must be licensed and have a seat ("Kassensitz") with public insurance
- You'll need preliminary sessions ("probatorische Sitzungen") before therapy is approved

Private Insurance Considerations

- Coverage varies significantly between private insurance plans
- Check your policy for limits on the number of sessions
- Some private insurers require you to pay upfront and submit claims for reimbursement
- Pre-existing conditions may affect coverage

When Insurance Won't Cover Treatment

- Self-pay options - Rates range from €80-150 per session

Adapting to Life in Germany new chapter

## Dealing with Culture Shock

Moving to Germany involves emotional phases that most expats experience regardless of their country of origin.

Understanding Culture Shock Phases

- Lack of familiar support systems
- Weather changes (particularly less sunlight in winter)
- Different food options and meal times

Practical Management Strategies

- Identify specific sources of frustration to address systematically
- Find a cultural mentor - a local or long-time expat

When to Seek Help

- Persistent sleep problems

## Coping Strategies for Homesickness

Homesickness affects nearly all expats at some point, but you can manage these feelings effectively.

Create Comfort in Your Space

- Bring meaningful items from home for your living space
- Cook familiar dishes from your home country
- Create a dedicated video call space for connecting with family
- Develop new routines that become your "normal" in Germany
- Make your home comfortable for the German climate (proper heating, light therapy lamps)

Connect with Home Strategically

- Schedule regular video calls with family and friends
- Create shared online photo albums for ongoing connection
- Send and receive care packages with comfort items

- Distinguish between general homesickness and specific concerns
- Create a "homesickness first aid kit" with items, photos, music
- Set small daily goals to prevent withdrawal
- Track your progress with a calendar or journal

## Building Resilience as an Expat

Resilience - the ability to adapt and bounce back from challenges - is essential for long-term expat success.

Develop Realistic Expectations

- Research cultural differences before situations arise
- Understand that adjustment takes 6-18 months for most people
- Recognize that not every day will be positive or productive
- Accept that some German systems won't change to accommodate you
- Know that language learning progresses in plateaus, not steady improvement

Create Support Networks

- Build connections with multiple expat groups, not just one
- Develop relationships with German neighbors and colleagues
- Join sports clubs or hobby groups to meet people with shared interests
- Find a "language tandem" partner for mutual learning
- Connect with religious or spiritual communities if relevant
- Create an emergency contact network for practical help

Maintain Your Identity While Adapting

- Identify your core values that transcend cultural differences
- Continue practices that define your personal identity
- Share your culture with interested Germans
- Find ways to use your unique skills and perspectives
- Balance integration with maintaining your authentic self
- Recognize when to adapt and when to respectfully maintain differences

Strengthen Your Problem-Solving Skills

- Break down challenges into manageable steps
- Create templates for common bureaucratic processes
- Build a resource library of helpful websites and contacts
- Find German friends willing to help with phone calls or letters
- Learn key phrases for handling specific situations
- Document solutions for future reference

Celebrate Small Wins

- Recognize each bureaucratic hurdle you overcome
- Acknowledge language milestones (first joke, dream, argument)
- Celebrate the first time you help another newcomer
- Take photos of your "firsts" in Germany
- Create rewards for achieving integration goals
- Share your successes with friends and family

Practice Self-Care

- Develop a routine that includes physical activity
- Find outdoor spaces that uplift your mood
- Learn German relaxation customs (sauna culture, Kneipp treatments)
- Schedule regular connection with people who "get" your experience
- Create boundaries around cultural immersion when needed
- Allow yourself occasional "expat bubble" days
- Give yourself permission to feel all emotions about your experience

Remember that adaptation is neither linear nor complete. Even long-term expats experience occasional culture shock and homesickness. Your resilience toolkit will grow over time, making each challenge easier to navigate than the last.

# SECTION IX: FINANCIAL AND LEGAL MATTERS

## Chapter 21: Taxes and Financial Planning

### German Tax System Overview

The German tax system features:

- Progressive income tax rates from 14% to 45%
- Solidarity surcharge of 5.5% of income tax (partially eliminated in 2021)
- Church tax if registered with a recognized church (8-9% of income tax)
- Social security contributions separate from income tax
- Tax ID number (Steueridentifikationsnummer) assigned to all residents
- Annual tax return (Steuererklärung) due July 31 of the following year

As a resident, you're taxed on worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on German-source income.

The tax year in Germany is the calendar year (January 1 to December 31).

### Double Taxation Agreements

Germany has tax treaties with over 90 countries to prevent double taxation. These agreements determine:

- Which country has the right to tax different types of income
- Tax credit mechanisms for taxes paid abroad
- Special provisions for certain professions or income types

Common situations covered by tax treaties:

- Employment income
- Freelance/self-employed income
- Investment income
- Rental income
- Pensions
- Capital gains

Check the specific treaty between Germany and your home country to understand your tax obligations.

### Special Considerations for Expats

Specific tax considerations for expats include:

- Initial 183-day rule to determine residency
- Foreign income reporting requirements
- Foreign asset disclosure
- Special provisions for diplomatic staff
- Tax-free allowances for certain foreign income
- Deductions for relocation expenses

New residents often benefit from filing a tax return even if not required, as many receive refunds.

### AIRE Registration for Italian Citizens

Italian citizens must register with AIRE (Anagrafe degli Italiani Residenti all'Estero):

- Register at the Italian consulate in your region
- Required when staying abroad for more than 12 months
- Affects tax residency status in Italy
- Impacts voting rights in Italian elections
- Determines which country provides healthcare
- Required for consular services abroad

Failure to register can result in continued tax obligations in Italy despite paying German taxes.

### Country-Specific Tax Requirements

Different nationalities face unique requirements:

- US citizens: Must file US tax returns regardless of residency (worldwide taxation)
- UK citizens: May have tax obligations depending on residency status and returning intention
- Chinese citizens: Should deregister tax residency when moving abroad
- Indian citizens: Tax residency based on physical presence and income source

Most countries base tax obligations on:

- Residency status
- Source of income
- Length of time outside home country
- Permanent home location

Consult a tax advisor familiar with both German tax law and your home country's requirements.

- Receipts for medical expenses, childcare, donations
- IBAN for any refunds

#### Main forms

- Mantelbogen: main form with personal and general information

#### Deductible expenses

In Germany, many expenses can be deducted, including:

- Commuting costs (Pendlerpauschale)

- Paper by mailing the forms to the Finanzamt
- Through a tax advisor (Steuerberater) or tax assistance associations (Lohnsteuerhilfeverein)

_Receiving and reading the Bescheid  
_After submission, the Finanzamt sends you the Steuerbescheid, which is the result of your declaration. This document shows any refund or amount due. It's important to check the accuracy of the data: if there are errors, you can file an appeal (Einspruch).

_Frequently asked questions_

Do I have to file the Steuererklärung every year?

Only if you are required or if you want to claim refunds.

Can I do it in English?

No, the forms are in German, but many software solutions offer multilingual assistance.

- Develop relationships with other residents' families for mutual support

Whether planning for yourself or helping elderly parents, understanding Germany's senior care options early allows for thoughtful decisions rather than crisis responses.

# Religion and Kirchensteuer

## Overview of Religion in Germany

Religion plays a significant role in German culture and public life, though religious participation has declined in recent decades.

Main Religious Groups

- Catholicism - Predominant in Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, and Rhineland
- Protestantism - More common in northern and eastern regions
- Islam - Germany's largest minority religion with approximately 5 million adherents
- Judaism - Small but historically significant community with growing numbers
- Eastern Orthodox - Primarily among Greek, Russian, and Romanian communities
- Non-religious - Around 38% of the population identifies as non-religious

Religion in Public Life

- Many public holidays based on Christian calendar
- Religious symbols in some public buildings, especially in southern states
- School curriculum includes religious education (with secular alternatives)
- Stores close on Sundays due to religious tradition
- Religious organizations run many hospitals, kindergartens, and social services

Regional Differences

- Southern states (especially Bavaria) maintain stronger Catholic traditions
- Eastern states show higher rates of non-religious populations due to GDR history
- Cities tend to be more secular than rural areas
- Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen have highly diverse religious landscapes

## Understanding Kirchensteuer (Church Tax)

Germany has a unique system where the government collects taxes for certain religious communities.

Basic Mechanics

- 8-9% surcharge on your income tax (varies by state)
- Collected by the tax office (Finanzamt) along with regular income tax
- Funds religious institutions, charitable work, and social services
- Applies only to registered members of participating religious bodies
- Major participating groups: Catholic Church, Protestant Church, Jewish communities

Who Must Pay

- German citizens and residents who are officially registered as members of these religions
- Your religious affiliation appears on your tax card (Lohnsteuerkarte)
- Registration typically occurs through baptism or other religious ceremonies
- Foreign residents become liable when they register their religion on official forms
- The tax applies regardless of whether you actively practice your religion

Impact on Expats

- You need to declare your religious status when registering your residence
- If you state your religion and it participates in church tax, you automatically pay
- The tax adds approximately €800-1,200 annually for someone earning €50,000
- No automatic exemption for foreigners - your citizenship doesn't matter
- When changing jobs, verify your religious status on employment paperwork

Tax Calculation Example

- Annual income: €60,000
- Income tax: approximately €14,000
- Church tax at 9%: €1,260 additional tax
- Total church tax over 10 years: €12,600+

## Opting Out and Implications

You can opt out of church tax, but this decision carries both practical and social consequences.

Formal Opt-Out Process

- Visit your local district court (Amtsgericht) or registry office (Standesamt)
- Complete a formal declaration of church exit (Kirchenaustritt)
- Pay an administrative fee (€30-60 depending on location)
- Receive official confirmation of your exit
- Report your new status to your employer's HR department
- The process cannot be completed online or by mail in most states

Practical Consequences

- No longer required to pay church tax
- Cannot receive certain religious services:
  - Church weddings
  - Religious funeral services
  - Confirmation or First Communion for children
  - Godparent responsibilities
- May affect admission to church-run schools or kindergartens
- No automatic right to rejoin later (readmission is discretionary)
- Potentially impacts employment with church-run organizations

Social Considerations

- In rural or traditional areas, church membership carries social significance
- Family expectations may conflict with personal financial decisions
- Children's participation in religious milestones may be affected
- Consider how this impacts future plans like religious weddings

Middle-Ground Options

- Some expats declare "no religion" upon initial registration to avoid the tax
- Consider timing your exit before major income increases
- Contribute voluntarily to religious organizations at a level you choose
- Join free evangelical churches that don't participate in church tax

Important Notes for Expats

- Check if your home country has a similar church tax system
- Understand that German churches rely heavily on this funding model
- Research your specific religious community's policies on church tax exit
- Consider speaking with a tax advisor about your specific situation

The church tax system often surprises expats from countries without similar arrangements. Consider your personal religious practice, financial situation, and cultural integration goals when deciding how to approach this uniquely German institution.
